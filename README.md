## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Medical records are encrypted and stored on IPFS, ensuring data availability and integrity.
- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients have full control over who can access their medical records.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All access and modifications to records are logged on the blockchain, providing a transparent history.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes Stacks Authentication for secure, self-sovereign identity management.
- **Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing**: Implements zero-knowledge proofs for sharing specific data without revealing entire records.
- **Interoperability**: Designed with future integration with existing healthcare systems in mind.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Frontend**: React.js with Web3 integration
- **Decentralized Storage**: InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
- **Authentication**: Stacks Authentication

## Smart Contracts

Our dApp is powered by three core smart contracts:

1. **Patient Record Contract**: Manages the creation, updating, and retrieval of patient records.
2. **Access Control Contract**: Handles permissions and access rights for different users and roles.
3. **Consent Management Contract**: Manages patient consent for data sharing and access.
